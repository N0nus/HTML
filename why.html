            <h2>The Benefits of Building Your Own PC</h2>
            <p>
                There are many benefits to building your own PC. You save money on assembly, you can easily repair and replace damaged parts, you can avoid paying for unecessary components, and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, before you can start building, it is important to ask yourself what you want to use your PC for. Depending on what you want to do with it, you can customize your PC so that it performs all the tasks you need it to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ask yourself what kinds of activities you will be using your PC for and how much value will you get out of investing in each part. For example, if you plan on playing graphics-intesive games or doing a lot of 3d rendering, it would make sense to pay more for a better graphics card.
